Analysis:

With the information I have sorted, received and ranked I have crafted the two theories I have created based upon.

1. The schools with higher funding do not have as high pass rates as lower funded schools. This could be due to a myriad of smaller issues; outdated schoolwork, lack of futhering education or simply just not able to provide more challenge material to the students. I refer the last point that the lower funded schools have higher passing rates and it may be due to those items listed out earlier. 

2. Schools with higher funder have a smaller percent passing but, this could also be due to a variety of factors: the more higher end materials could present more of a challenge than a school with lower funding. Activities, social status or even simply the material being harder due to have more funding could be why these have such a drastic difference between them..
